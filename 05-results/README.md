# This directory contains the results of the analysis of BGCs in palaeofaeces
- `PREP_Nextflow_EAGER_noReads.tsv`: This file contains the number of reads before and after preprocessing
- `COMP_MetaPhlan4_alignedreads.tsv`: Contains the number of reads that aligned to a specific sequence in the databank for the compositional analysis
- `COMP_MetaPhlan4_species_profiles.tsv`: Contains a profile of all species and taxa found in the samples, identified by MetaPhlan$
- `summary_aDNA_assembly.tsv`: This is the result of the assembly process. It consists of information about the contigs that have been assembled in all samples. In addition to that information about the amount of aDNA damage can be found
- `binning_metawrap.tsv`: Shows bins and their quality, found in all samples
- `ANNO_BGC_contig_taxclassification.tsv`: A table showing the taxonomic classification of the contigs with a detected BGC
- `QUAL_pyDamage_results_BGCcontigs.tsv`: shows aDNA damage as identified by pyDamage of the contigs with a detected BGC
